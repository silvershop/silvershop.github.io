                <h2>Shop 1.1.1 Released</h2>
                <p>We've just released 1.1.1 which is mostly a bugfix release. It also keeps us current with SilverStripe 3.2. Shop has run fine on 3.2 for a while but the tests weren't passing until recently. As a side note, the same is true of SS 4.0/master - everything runs fine but the tests aren't passing yet.</p>
