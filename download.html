  			<p>The easiest way to setup SilverShop is through Composer. This will setup SilverShop with the latest version of SilverStripe and all the dependencies you require.</p>

  			<p><pre><code>composer create-project silverstripe/installer myshop
composer require -d myshop "silvershop/core"
</code></pre></p>

			<p>If you do not have composer setup then you can download the required
			package from <a href="https://github.com/silvershop/silvershop-core">Github</a>.</p>

			<p>Additional functionality can be found in the supported add-ons listed on our <a href="https://github.com/silvershop/">Github Page</a></p>
